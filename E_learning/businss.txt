Hello, I need a database structure for an e-learning platform. Here's the overview of what I want:

    Users:

        There should be three types of users: Learners, Instructors, and Admins.

        Each user should have basic information like name, email, password, and country for learners. Instructors should have additional qualifications. Admins should have a role field (such as superadmin, supportadmin, contentadmin).

    Courses:

        Courses will have a name, description, and category.

        Each course will have an instructor (foreign key reference to instructors).

        I also need to store course content such as videos, PDFs, quizzes, and text documents.

    Enrollment:

        Learners should be able to enroll in courses. I need to track progress and the enrollment date.

        A learner should only be able to enroll in the same course once.

    Evaluation:

        For each course, there should be quizzes with questions. Each question will have a correct answer.

        After completing quizzes, learners should be able to submit answers, and we should store whether their answers were correct.

    Feedback:

        Learners should be able to leave feedback on courses with ratings (from 1 to 5).

        The feedback should include comments about the course.

    Certification:

        Upon course completion, learners should receive a certification with the date of acquisition.

    Support:

        Admins should be able to handle support requests from learners. Support tickets should track the admin responses and status (open or resolved).
